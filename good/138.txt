Something new for my wife. She is still earning how to navigate the item but enjoys more apps at her finger tips. Its small and compact and easy t take on trips so she can read, take pictures or listen to her music.
I like the shape and size of this Kindle, and the graphics are good. But if I play a game for very long the charge seems to run out pretty quickly. It is very good for books and for music. I would recommend it for those categories.
