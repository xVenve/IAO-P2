Good product for the money. Compared to earlier versions not as durable. The outside casing is plastic. Not good. For the money good buy.
Nice tablet with the slightly bigger screen, great for tv, movies and reading especially for older eyes. Good size as well, it fits nicely into a purse or tote without being too heavy
