We purchased this for our 5 & 4 yr olds. It is something to help with learning to read and write.The big downfall is that even the "free" apps require you to purchase add-ons to unlock more of the app.
This is a great tablet. It has amazing storage. I use mine daily. Great for reading, surfing the web and games. The one small thing I don't like is Amazon prime shows are a bit dark for some reason. Hulu and Netflix work wonderful.
