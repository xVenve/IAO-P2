The Kindle is a great tablet for minor tasks and games or for a child. I haven't had it long, but I'm able to use it for what I bought it for, e-books for school.
The tablet has a very clear and crisp screen. The device is easy to setup. There is a quite abit of preinstalled apps. The responsiveness is great, connectivity is good, but sound is not great.
