Great starter tablet, but let's face it... It's a Kindle at heart. Still, it's pretty awesome for a Kindle!!!
I love my kindle, it is what I like to use at the end of the day or for business trips. The only annoying things are the amount of advertising the put on this version. It was only $35 for Christmas so I can't complain.
