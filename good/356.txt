I own 3 of these kindles, for my children who are young. They can take some wear and tear, but recently one of mine quit charging. The charger will no longer connect with the port inside the kindle. The kindle itself was working just fine, but since it can no longer be charged, it is no longer functioning. I am really disappointed, and plan on buying a replacement. My children love being able to play on the kindle and for the price you really can't beat the deal.
Great product. I got this as a gift for a family member and she loves it.
