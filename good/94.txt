Th size difference is noticeable and squarish rather then rectangular, which I prefer. The Kindle unit itself is rather nice, the auto rotate and adjust being the best part. I returned this item b/c the cover is flimsy. and I was afraid I would drop it and break the kindle.
This feels like an affordable tablet. While not the best in class, it isn't priced to be that either. Works well. Happy with purchase.
