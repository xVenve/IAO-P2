Decent tablet. I knew it wouldn't be fast but it does get the job done and it was relatively cheap.
Good for watching movies, reading books and playing games but don't expect to do much more. Everything else can be a challenge and it can get laggy and once in a while it'll just shut down a program or completely reboot.
