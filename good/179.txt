Bought this for myself at Christmas as a replacement for my older version. This one has clearer graphics but I find the build to be way cheaper and definitely a great deal thinner..felt to flimsy to me.
Excellent price point for my basic requirements. It has all the features I need for comfortable reading of online novels and articles.
