I like the Kindle Fire. I use it to access my movies and apps. I use it for my gaming apps.
I decided to buy this instead of a traditional kindle and I do not regret my decision at all!The only con (for those evaluating this as a tablet) is that Amazon has their own App Store. Many apps from GooglePlay/AppStore are simply not available.
