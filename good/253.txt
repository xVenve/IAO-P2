I don't know how to use this stupid tablet, but my kids sure love it. We've downloaded games and movies for the kids, and they seem to be fairly entertained by the darn thing. We bought one for Christmas, and ended up getting a second one so the kids stop fighting.
We bought the tablet for our kid and it actually is good for her.
