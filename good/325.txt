it's just ok for a tablet, it doesn't have google play store of course which limits a wide variety. I would think by now they would offer most of the play store apps but nope. It's slow and browser doesn't load pages with flash or graphics good. poor camera. but it functions ok for a cheap tablet. i didn't expect a lot, but did expect better from kindle.
I bought this 8" Amazon Fire HD for my Wife as a Christmas Present. Her old 7" Amazon Fire that she had for about 3-4 Years. She is very happy with the 8" Amazon Fire HD. Can't beat the price for a Tablet.
