Though I have got it for cheap price during black friday, this Fire is not that great. Very bad camera and dim screen resolution. Pros:Install Google Play without any hassleVery good book reading option
Wanted my father to have his first tablet and this is a very good value. He can watch movies and play a few games. Easy enough for him to use.
