Bought this for my 82 year old dad. It was to complicated for him to use. I couldn't figure enough of it out to be able to explain it all to him in the time I was visiting him. Returned and bought a different kind.
Bought this for my 8 year old in place of a Nabi that didn't work out of the package. Great basic tablet for this.
