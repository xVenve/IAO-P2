Logging in with a password can be difficult since the typed lettersare not shown, even temporarily, so inadvertent typos require guesswork to find.Signing out of e-mail is not clear, if it can be done.Some "free" downloads fail because of lack of payment.Allowing for my lack of skills. I was hoping for a little more.It was OK fort basic stuff.
Have been pleased with my purchase of the Fire HD8 as it's video quality is great when viewing ESPN3/Netflix/YouTube Tutorials.The ability to easily load and read my saved textbooks within the Amazon Kindle App is fantastic for a fraction of the price for an IPAD. : )
