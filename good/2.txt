The tablet works fine. It is responsive with good resolution. It is too tied to Amazon. It requires too many hoops to get apps such as Zinio to work. Until Amazon loosens its grip, I recommend only at a very good price.
Great for e-reading on the go, nice and light weight, and for the price point given, definitely worth the purchase.
