Its cheap, but the you will notice the low screen resolution compared to iPad. App is somewhat limited unless you side load it.
Good tablet for basic needs. Screens resolution is pretty good. Mostly using for reading and sometimes for watching movies/shows. Great feature is the possibility to use the card to expand the memory. Good product for great price!
