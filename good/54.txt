At this price point it is very good. But having being used ipad the display doesnt look sharp. Amazon app store lacks content. Overall good for my 9 yr old.
Bought it on black Friday for 60$ .Value for money tablet. It lags at heavy tasks and also apps are reloaded when 2-3 apps are opened at same time. But at this price it is expected. Go for it if budget is <100$.
