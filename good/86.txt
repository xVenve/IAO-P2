The product has a $90 price tag and the 90 warranty is too short. My tablet died within a month. I took it to Best Buy where they said they don't handle the warranty, went to Amazon web site where they said go to the store where I bought the device. After much digging around Amazon web site I found out who would help me. I gave it a one star and Amazon helped me quick. We were able to get it going again, a manual would help. The device works again. I found the tablet to be very functional, I watch Netflix, listen to Spotify, watch YouTube videos, it works great!
