Works well but lacks forward control of screen and right and left movement on keyboard. Good foor short notes but could never do any substantial typing on this without external keyboard. Good for basic websurfing and email.
Not as fancy as the ipad, but a fraction of the cost works well with android system and all apps like on our android phones, cant beat the price
