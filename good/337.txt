Slightly slow. However, really good for the price. Also... these Amazon tablets don't use the normal google app store... they use the Amazon app store, which is not as extensive as the Google App store. This can be a significant drawback.
The only reason why I have not given a 5 star review is because sometimes, the unit freezes out of nowhere after I will be reading news articles or after watching Prime/Netflix
