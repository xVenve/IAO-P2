I had wanted a Fire for about 3 Years but didn't pick one up but this time I did. Wasn't what I thought it would be like.
Great little tablet for cruzing the internet and using Amazon products. I purchased it hoping I could use it as an inexpensive screen for my DJI Phantom 4. It works OK in this fashion, but I believe it is underpowered for the job.
