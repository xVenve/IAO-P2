This tablet is AWESOME to say the least, however the charger port is faulty and does not work properly. I need a replacement for my granddaughter who absolutely LOVES this product, as well as my other two grandchildren. Their Kindle is a staple in their lives!
Great product for my 10 year old son. Very easy for him to find what he wants
