My father upgraded from the original Kindle Fire to this model, and he's very happy with it. It doesn't compete with more mainstream tablets, but he likes the Kindle's system for downloading library books.
I have enjoyed the new Kindle,however, was extremely disappointed that it does not have an HDMI port like the old version did.
