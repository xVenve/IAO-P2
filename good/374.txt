Bought this on sale during Black Friday. Disappointed that there aren't more apps available. Will be returning.
For the price, this tablet is not bad. I found a couple of things that is a bit annoying. Every time you turn on the device, ads will appear in the lock screen. Also the picture gallery, it takes several minutes to load. The wait is very annoying.
