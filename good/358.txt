Was a bit difficult to initially set up. Ease in operations would be great, the tablet doesn't hold battery well at all. It seems that maybe and hour or two goes by before time to re-up on battery life.
This is a great tablet. My family and I love it. Lots of feature and faster than I thought it would be.
