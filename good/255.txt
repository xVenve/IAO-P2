This is not a bad tablet for the price. I personally need a little more on high end side. The plastic look doesn't do it for me.It has a expandable Micro Sd Slot and decent battery life. I gifted it to the Mrs. and she loves it.
Only problem is that it is impossible to read or do anything on the KindleFire with any light in the room at all; far worse than impossible in sunlight. There should be some sort of temporary screen or other add-on that can be used with the device when in sunny or bright locations.
