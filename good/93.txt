The Kindle Fire HD is perfect for playing simple games and for streaming video while away from home. It's thin and light.
I tested this item before I gave it as a gift. It is simple enough for the needs of browsing, social media and entertainment. Definitely best price for simple needs compared to spending $100s on an iPad
