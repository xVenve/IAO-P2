Bought as a gift for mom. I've seen one before nothing spectacular but they work. Fixed a screen for a friends last year. It took maybe 20 minutes so that's a plus.
Pretty good tablet especially for the price. That being said, it could be slightly faster when opening apps and running certain processes. Overall good machine for the price.
