I bought a first generation Kindle Fire a few years back, when it was on sale for something like 185.00 and loved it. It took a bit of a beating and I had recently begun to think about buying a replacement. I think that original tablet would probably be more comparable to the Fire HD 10 or something. So my experience with this version is colored by the higher quality first generation model. I also use a Surface Pro tablet as my personal/work computer, so that too probably color my opinion. Out of the box this is lighter than the original. Upon powering up, the original bookshelf carousel is now replaced by a more standard tablet home screen. In terms of processing speed this version feels a little slow. Games I had on the original seem to struggle a bit on the new Fire. Web-browsing is not terrible but is not terribly fast either. In the end, if you want a good e-reader on a budget with a few extra features, this is a great buy. If you're looking for a serious small tablet, you may wish to add a bit more to your budget and get one of the older siblings.
It's not a regular tablet but I just use it to use Facebook
