It was a nice tablet for the price. It's a nice beginner tablet and a good tablet for children.
This tablet is great considering how affordable it is! I mainly use it for reading, streaming shows, and listening to music. I do wish it was a true Android platform instead of the "Amazon Android" platform, but overall it's a great little tablet!
