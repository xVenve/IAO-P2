The Tablet is good for Kid's Basic use to watch Videos and play few games. Touch should be improved.
This was bought to replace my old Kindle with keypad, and experimental internet. Was surprised how much the Kindle had changed, and at the same price as my old one was when I bought it!Have already shown it to a couple of friends who now say they are thinking about getting one.
