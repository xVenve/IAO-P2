Pretty slow if you're trying to use it as a full-time tablet. Good as an eReader and sometimes game and Internet usage.
Very descent for a non-IPAD. Good speakers. Great price. The screen is a little dark. Great buy if you have Amazon Prime since you can download stuff and watch it offline (great for trips, etc...). Overall great cheap IPAD or even as a back-up tablet. Terrific battery life too.
