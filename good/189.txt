It's a great tablet for the price. I bought it as a gift and they loved it.
For the price and features offered on the tablet, I wouldn't purchase any other tablet. I enjoy using it and overall find it fairly easy to navigate. Easy internet browser with "Silk" and convenient access to all the applications I am interested in.
