I use this primarily as a reader; however, it has a smaller number of unread books that are not in the familiar "carousel" as in other Kindle readers. As a tablet it is faster, brighter and more clear than other tablets that I have used for internet purposes. I would recommend this product to anyone who uses a tablet or a reader.
