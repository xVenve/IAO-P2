I purchased this tablet knowing exactly what my needs were and how well the Kindle could meet them. Despite the "walled garden" philosophy that tethers you mostly to Amazon products and services, the ability (as of right now) to side-load the Google Play Store makes this a surprisingly versatile device for the price point.
