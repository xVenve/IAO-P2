Great inexpensive tablet for everyday use. It's not powerful enough for super graphical games but it's great for basic apps like surfing the web, emails, news, etc. Amazon has "underground" apps which is totally free (including in-app purchases). Only downside with those is that you sometimes see a full screen ads in them (usually products that's on your Amazon wishlist). All-in-all, it's a great tablet that you don't have to worry about if you break it.
