Well worth the 80 bucks, especially if you are an Amazon Prime member. You can download and watch anything on there for free, including movies and magazines. The screen is a bit on the darker side, but the battery life is great. I have both an IPAD and this, and I use both. Great when you are waiting for your IPAD to recharge...
