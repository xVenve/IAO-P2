Purchased Amazon Fire TV due to previous reviews stating that it performs fast with PlayStation Vue. Tried it out for a month and all it did was constantly buffer. Checked my internet speed and router/modem and I have the fastest 1GB speed available. Reviews on PlayStation Vue state that Roku interface is not as good, so I purchased Amazon Fire Stick to determine if it has better performance. Love the Amazon Fire Stick. Extremely fast and no buffering with online streaming with PlayStation Vue on the Amazon Fire Stick. Save your money and get the stick.
