After about two weeks I ended up returning this item. It constantly froze and when it was working it was no faster than my fire stick.The voice search was a joke. I'm pretty tied in to the Amazon ecosystem, I love my Echo, but I was disappointed with this device. And for a hundred dollars? No thanks.
