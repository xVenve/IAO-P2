This tablet conked out on me the first day I powered it on. The Amazon symbol came up and never went past that screen. I was highly annoyed because I purchased it as a first to send it out of the country. My biggest mistake was trusting that everything would work fine, instead I should've powered on the device to ensure everything was fine.
