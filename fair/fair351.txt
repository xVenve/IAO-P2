Worked wonderful and fast the first couple of weeks and then just stopped working. I understand that sometimes things are just a defective piece so I logged into Amazon and attempted to exchange it,, but found out the window for exchanging it had closed. I would have attempted to return it sooner but I was out of state for several weeks visiting and helping my daughter who had just given birth to triplets, and so I'd decided I would just wait till I returned home to do it. By the time I got around to it, it was too late. So I totally wasted my money. If Amazon corrects this matter and send me a replacement, I will update my review.
