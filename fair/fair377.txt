Bought the FireStick after daughter got one and loved it. Went to get a second and they were out of stock. Was told the FireTV had faster processor and could handle 4K...don't have 4K, and honestly it's not worth the extra money for the processor speed difference ...save money and buy the cheaper FireStick
