I want to start out by pointing out that I honestly was not expecting much to begin with. I was just hoping for something backlit to read with at night. My problem with it is that it was slow to the point where it was almost unusable. Just bite the bullet and get a more expensive model if you're new to Amazon Fire. This is not representative of the experience of owning one.
