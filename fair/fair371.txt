I purchased this device to stream movies to a room that had minimal apps. The I tried to activate Netflix, I kept getting an error on log-in. Then after contacting Amazon Tech help & researching found out that Amazon & Netflix parted ways and do not support each other. So, I returned the device and purchased the Roku4 instead to great satisfaction.
