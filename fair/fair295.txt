I had a Nook, but it died so I wanted a replacement, and bought this Fire tablet on black friday last year because it was very inexpensive, but as the old adage goes, you get what you pay for. It's OK for basic web surfing, but it's limited, slow, and has one little speaker on the back so if you lay it on a table you won't be able to hear it very well.
