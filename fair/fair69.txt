...but WiFi isn't working great. I have love Amazon Kindles since my first one, replaced it with a 7" Fire HD, then got 7" Fires...multiple ones. Problem is the last 3 work with wifi for a while, then start having problems. Reset wireless modem worked for a while, then hard reset did, now won't work for wifi at all. Will keep trying, though.
