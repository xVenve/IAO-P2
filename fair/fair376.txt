Item was DOA. Reached out to Amazon IT who this happens often. I stand gratification was thrown straight out the window. I returned the item to BB where I purchased the Appel tv. Much better product and works, which is more than I can say for the Fire TV. I give the item a 2 star instead of a 1 because Amazons IT was quick to answer the phone and troubleshoot.
