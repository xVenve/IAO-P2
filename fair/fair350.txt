got this newer charger as it was indicated to charge faster than the one that came with my fire hdx 8.9 4th generation tablet. well i am currently using this new charger and am getting alerts on the fire tablet that i am hooked up to a low power charger it is plugged directly into the wall socket with the 5ft micro-usb cable i also just bought for it. this is not right. is it junk is it false advertising is the fire tablet wrong in its notification what is the deal amazon. i have been a loyal user but this is really not right.
