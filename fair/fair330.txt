So sorry I bought this, had to change its wake up name to echo from Alexa it wouldn't answer to Alexa, on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being terrible I'll rate it a 2 most of the time didn't know how to answer or didn't understand the question, did all the self help and with amazon customer service am ready to return it
