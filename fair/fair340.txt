Alexa is tall, slim and attractive but too jealous to use Google and that makes her rather dumb. And she is just a shill for Amazon prime. Dropping the personification, music volume changes annoyingly with different songs and over time. The database Amazon Echo draws from is very limited: Alexa can tell you what the weather is but not what the most common woman's shoe size is; what Serena Williams' age is but not how many guns Ruger sold last year. Stand by for more tech-savvy companies to take the Echo concept to maturity.
