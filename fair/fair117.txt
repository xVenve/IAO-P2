From the first time I used it, the pages kept freezing and didn't respond to touch commands. I had to turn it off and back on daily. I tried to get a replacement and was told they no longer have them and I'd have to pay $10. more for a newer model. I bought 2 (1 as a gift). So far 1 works and 1 didn't.
