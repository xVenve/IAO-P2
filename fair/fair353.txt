Not the best case Amazon has ever put out! I have a number of other Amazon brand Kindle and Kindle Fire cases for my various Kindle devices and this is the least effective of the bunch. It doesn't stand in any position, so I can't use my 6 hands free. It also doesn't line up properly when closed, so the Fire seems to come out of sleep mode, thus draining the battery more quickly. And finally, I have discovered that I do prefer the leather covers over whatever material this is made from. I understand that the cost of a leather case would probably be half the cost of the Kindle Fire HD 6...not that this case was any bargain at 30!!
