A wonderfully designed device, but its use is fairly limited. I bought it primarily to use as a Smart Home control device. However, although it allows you to turn on and off lights, you cannot add timers to the control instructions. For instance, you cannot tell the Echo to turn off a light in 30 minutes; you can only tell it to turn it off or on immediately. Finding that out was incredible disappointing. I don't know understand why it would be so hard to add such a feature.
