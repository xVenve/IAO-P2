No matter what I asked, either Alexa didn't know the answer, or offered to order an item that I didn't ask for, with a prime membership.Couldn't even get my weather forecast right.Kept giving me the forcast for an area 20 miles away.I returned it.By the way, whatever I ask for from" ok Google" I get an answer that is usually 99% correct.Never asks me to pay for a $99 membership or offer to order something online for me.Don't need it. Don't want it.
