Full disclosure, I've only had iPads in the past. I needed an android based tablet as a 3rd party app that I needed was yet IOS supported. You get what you pay for. Build quality, touch and feel, yes it's equal to the price. Constant adds urging you to make various Amazon based purchases...not my cup of tea but I guess fills a price point and need.
