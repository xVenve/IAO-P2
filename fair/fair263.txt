I wanted to like this a lot because my Ipad Mini is "heavy" to carry in my purse all the time. This is so very light. BUT they make you jump through hoops to get rid of all the advertising on the device AND when you buy it at Best Buy you are not given a choice to "spend an extra 20 on a 119 dollar "book" or put up with their ads". I had to go through being on hold FOREVER to get someone to help get this off my device so that was an IMMEDIATE turn-off. I don't find it to page-turn handle as well as my OLD ORIGINAL NOOK OR NOOK COLOR and certainly not anything like the Ipad Mini. If I hadnt kept it too long to return I would have. It doesn't auto correct to landscape then portrate, nope you have to MANUALLY CHOOSE ONE OR THE OTHER AND GOING BACK AND FORTH IS just stupid...it should have been part of the IMPROVED design, THEY REALLY MISSED THE MARK FOR THE PRICE. i CAN GET A FULL TABLET FOR LESS MONEY THAT DOES ALL THAT AND SIMPLY USE THE KINDLE APPPROSLight weightSmall for purseback lightCONS1-comes preloaded with ads2-not easy to get them off if you buy device in a store3-page control is not that simple4-t doesn't auto turn from landscape to portrate you have to set it to one OR the other5-not as touch responsive to anything6-don't like the organization of it
