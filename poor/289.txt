We got this for our son. He is always wanting to play on Mom's tablet so we thought this would be a good choice. His aunt does a lot of tech shopping and bought this same one for his sister so we got the same one. Within a month the charging cord on both units quit working and shortly after that the ports became squirly so you have to hold them just right or they don't charge. Save your money and get a more expensive but better quality product.
