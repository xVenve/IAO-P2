This item is useless to play music through voice recognition unless you pay for an amazon prime or Amazon music account. Once that is disconnected she only plays your music through manual control from a blue tooth connection from your phone. Pointless!!! More than half the questions I ask her she doesn't know the answers to. The only thing she's good for so far is the time and weather. That basically the most expensive blue tooth speaker and clock I have ever purchased. I want my money back
