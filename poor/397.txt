I have 4 of the Gen 1 Fire Tv boxes and they are good showing their age. I purchased the new FireTV only be to disappointedPros.. SD Card slotCons.. Many Apps just don't work or are buggy...Search is terrible and only gives Amazon options .. Nvidia Shield also gives my plex server option .. now that is cool... not much faster.. if at all than Gen 1
