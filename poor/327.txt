Let's be realistic on two fronts about the Echo: (1) I'ts fun to play with, a novel idea. (2) There are some serious flaws and if you doubt me you can try these yourself. Ask Alexa these three questions:(1) "What is the Customer Service Number for UPS?". You'll be told the phone number of your nearest UPS store. No matter how you phrase the question.(2) "Alexa, what is the current humidity outside?". You'll get the days weather report no matter how you pose the question. Seriously, it cannot even provide the Humidity?(3) "Alexa, Who makes the 747 Jet?". You'll hear "Hmmm, I'm not sure what you meant by that question. So throw in a clue with "Alexa, who makes the Boeing 747 Jet?" and you'll hear the same answer. And this product is alleged to go out to the web to pull down information from Wikipedia, et al?(4) The reproduction of music is egregious at best. Read anywhere on the Internet and you'll see this mentioned time and time again. It's very, very bad. Imagine a 1960's Transistor Radio not quite tuned well..(5) The voice quality sounds like something from a Commodore-64 back in the 1980's. Another very common complaint you'll read about in reviews.This is going back tonight. Not worth the $179.00 and I feel it's slated to go the route of the Pet Rock (for those who remember it).
