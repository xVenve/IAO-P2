I purchased one as a Christmas gift. from Best Buy on line...it worked fine the first month,did not use it for a few weeks. I went to turn it on..did not get nothing .The lefthand bottom corner says "FASTBOOTH mode" It is locked on this and I get nothing else.Did not buy any product protection so I guess it is a complete loss.
