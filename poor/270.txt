Not for the average computer person. Very confusing instructions. I spent several hours trying to install the "overdrive" so I could get e-books from the library. Ran the battery down several times with no luck. I got so disgusted I had to just put it down. (I'm still trying because I refuse to give up) Thinking about just returning it and the nice leather case too!)
