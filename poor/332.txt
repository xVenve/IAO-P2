I bought this charger Nov 28 2015. It's now Jan 1 2016 (a little over a month later) and the device doesn't charge my kindle any longer. I have the kindle shutdown and allow it to be plugged in for multiple hours. After I take the charger off and start to use my Kindle within 30 minutes I see the Low Battery message. If I use the charger that came with my Kindle for the same amount of time I don't see the Low Battery message as quickly as I did with this charger. Not sure what's going on but makes me think I have a faulty device -- costs a lot of money for something that doesn't work any longer than 1 month
