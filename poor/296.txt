Found out after having had opened and tried programming this awesome alexa that basically nothing comes with it. It's a listening device in my home that won't do anything unless I pay more into Amazon. The fact that I synced my pandora account is pointless because I have to spell out what I want Alexa to play by saying, "Alexa play 'X' station from my pandora play list." How is the rest of my family suppose to know what to request when I am the only one who knows my pandora play list (and barely at that!) I have many complaints, and basically disappointed in my purchase. I was lead to believe this was the radio of the future. It is if I pay for the Amazon Music Unlimited monthly.
