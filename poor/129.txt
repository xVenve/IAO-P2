I got mine for a month, and I mainly use it to read PDF documents from SD card or OneDrive. The tablet is nothing like the reviews said. It FREEZES up every time I press "Home" or go to the next page or even to close out. When I go on the internet, some pages do not load fully. 9/10 times only the 1st half of the page was loaded. I am very disappointed.
