This thing is a disaster. Unless you are a child or have never used a tablet in your life, you are in for disappointment. They've blocked the Google store, so good luck downloading most of the games you like. Youtube? owned by Google, so again, can't download the app. You CAN get there with the web browser, but why should you have to? I tried to download 3 games-- NONE of which would even load. In short, I owned it less than 16 hours. Waste of my time. Save your money and buy a Samsung Galaxy Tablet.
