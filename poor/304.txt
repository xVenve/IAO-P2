Not as easy as it sounded like it was going to be. So many things to buy to get full use out of what we knew we COULD do. Every question we seem to ask Alexa/she says she doesn't know the answer and that we'd have to "download the app" - so we never use her/only to ask her to set a timer and tell us the time and ask her to play music, which we also had to set up first. Not as neat as we thought she was going to be.
