Has many educational apps I would definitely go into the settings if you're a mother like me who Is a very strict of what your children watch on TV or what games and apps they download I would definitely recommend setting the parental controls before giving it to them. In my personal opinion as a mother I feel it helps by setting the restrictions/content on It helps keep their mind away from the gutter Bcuz most apps and Internet websites have inappropriate sites children should not be watching. We can't control what they put on the Internet but we can control what our children watch and download they stay very occupied on educational apps ,read books most of these apps are free to I also recommend NOT putting a payment method option other than that my kids loved it
