While there are some apps that are missing due to not using the Google Play Store the list is minimal. The tablet itself is quick, responsive, and noticeable nicer than the 7" fire. Picked this up when it was on sale for black friday sales. It's great for in front of the TV and catching up on email and light web browsing.
