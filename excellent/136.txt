I previously had bought an older model of these tablets for my children. I wasn't to happy with them. But this tablet is great, it has child safety features like wether you would like to have them surf the web to even limiting the amount of hours your child can use it. Very good tablet for what my kids will use it for which is mostly Netflix Hulu and even though there isn't you tube app there are alternate apps that acces you tube.
